# assignment statements: (all variables are global, and can only store integers)
x := 1  
# conditional statements:
if x = 1, y := 2
elseif x = 2, y:=3
else, y := 4
end  
# while loops:
while x < 10,
x := x + 1
end

#compound statements:
x := 1;
y := 2;

## computing a factorial:
n := 5 # n!
p := 1
while n > 0,
p = p*n;
n = n - 1
end

## computing the nth term of a fibonacci series:
n := 5 # F_n
a := 1
b := 0
while n > 0,
c := a + b;
a := b
b := c
end

## structures: arithmetic expressions, boolean expressions, statements
arithmetic expressions:
1. integer constants (2)
2. variables (x)
3. binary operations (x - 2)
4. grouped binary operations ((x - 2)*4)
